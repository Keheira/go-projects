# go-projects
Small go projects to get better with using go language. I want a resource I can look back at as needed.

## How to Run
`go run <filename>.go`

## Want to see something?
If you want to see something specific feel free to submit an issue and I'll code it up when I can. On the other hand you can write it up and submit a PR.
